## Do ginger analysis by myself

First I would like to create snakemake, and snakemake will contain: 
1. QC fastq. ## handling the sequences we have.
2. Download reference from NCBI. ## the format should be gtf
3. Ginger blastp with Arabibopsis
4. Using RSEM to generate data which R need# Ginger_analysis
